#### What's the [TorBrowser](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/about/)?

1. Simply put, [Tor](https://support.torproject.org/about/what-is-tor/) is a software that allows you to access the Internet anonymously. Users can communicate anonymously on the Internet through Tor.

2. In order to achieve anonymity, Tor brings together computers scattered around the world to form an encrypted loop. When you access the Internet through the Tor network, your network data is sent in a circuitous way through multiple computers, covering up your network activities like an onion wrapped around its core. Information transmission is encrypted at every step, making it impossible to know your location. and information transfer destination. Therefore Tor Browser is also called the onion browser.

##### How Tor Works?

* Tor is a network of virtual tunnels that allows you to improve your privacy and security on the Internet. Tor works by sending your traffic through three random servers (also known as relays) in the Tor network. The last relay in the circuit (the "exit relay") then sends the traffic out onto the public Internet.

* The image above illustrates a user browsing to different websites over Tor. The green middle computers represent relays in the Tor network, while the three keys represent the layers of encryption between the user and each relay.

##### What's the traits of the 'TorBrowser'?

* Your internet service provider, and anyone watching your connection locally, will not be able to track your internet activity, including the names and addresses of the websites you visit.

* The operators of the websites and services that you use, and anyone watching them, will see a connection coming from the Tor network instead of your real Internet (IP) address, and will not know who you are unless you explicitly identify yourself.

* resist fingerprinting

#### What's is the [Dark Web](https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/12262331?hl=zh-)?

1.The *dark web* is the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) content that exists on [darknets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet): overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations, or authorization to access.

2.The dark web forms a small part of the [deep web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_web), the part of the web not indexed by web search engines(Such as [Google](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) or [Yahoo](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%9B%85%E8%99%8E)), although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.

##### What's the Dark Web used for?

* The dark web is often associated with illegal activities:  

  * drug-trafficking

  * data breaches
 
  * botnet
 
  * bitcoin services

* However, government agencies also use the dark web to: 

  * Share classified information

  * Perform other positive activities
 
##### What's the difference between 'Dark Web' and 'Deep Web'?

* The deep web refers to the parts of the internet that you canâ€™t reach through search engines like Google Search. While this includes the dark web, the deep web also includes pages that you can only find if you register or sign in, like most content provided by [Gmail](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gmail) and [Facebook](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook).

* The deep web includes 90 percent of the internet, while the dark web likely includes less than 0.01 percent.
